# Chatbot with Google PaLM and RAG Pipeline

## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains a chatbot built using the **Google PaLM (Pathways Language Model)** and designed with a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline. The chatbot is capable of intelligent, context-aware responses by integrating external knowledge retrieval with language generation.

This project demonstrates the potential of large language models (LLMs) in improving user interaction by combining state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Google PaLM Integration**: Utilizes one of the most advanced language models for natural language understanding and generation.
- **RAG Pipeline**: Combines retrieval of relevant information with generative capabilities for accurate and context-aware responses.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Fully interactive workflow for ease of experimentation and customization.
- **Extensible Framework**: Easily adaptable for other datasets, retrieval methods, or deployment environments.

## ⚙️ Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Walapalam/intellihack_raccoons_task3.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd intellihack_raccoons_task3
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Usage
Running the Chatbot
Open notebooks/chatbot_demo.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook

Follow the step-by-step instructions inside the notebook

Modify the parameters or input your own queries for testing

Example Query
plaintext
Copy
Edit
User: What is the capital of France?  
Bot: The capital of France is Paris.
🧱 Architecture
The chatbot is built around a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline:

Query Understanding
The user query is parsed and analyzed.

Knowledge Retrieval
Relevant information is fetched from a predefined knowledge base or external API.

Response Generation
The retrieved data is combined with the generative model (Google PaLM) to produce a context-aware response.

📝 (You can optionally include a visual architecture diagram in the docs/ folder for better understanding.)
